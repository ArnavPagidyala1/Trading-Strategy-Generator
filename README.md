# tradingAlgorithm

This trading algorithm looks back on certain time periods of trading data(closing prices) to find out when it's best to buy or sell shares

Input the stock ticker, starting year, and end year to let the script create a strategy

Note: This script uses Quandl which means the API can be called only a certain amount of times per day
